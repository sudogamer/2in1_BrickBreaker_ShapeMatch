* To overcome CORS policy restrictions please follow below steps,
1. Serve your game files through a local server. This makes the files accessible via http:// or https:// rather than file://, which avoids the CORS restriction.
2. If you have Python installed, it's very easy to start a simple HTTP server. Navigate to your game directory in the command prompt or terminal. Run python -m http.server (for Python 3) or python -m SimpleHTTPServer (for Python 2).
   Your game will be served at http://localhost:8000.
3. Open your web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, etc.). Navigate to the local server URL. Since the server is running on port 8000, you would type http://localhost:8000/ in your browser's address bar.
4. Select MainMenu.html
